Teacup
====================

Physically based CPU renderer developed from scratch with the purpose of exploring computer graphics.

Build
====================

Teacup uses the [CMake](https://cmake.org) build system.

By default, generated builds will compile an optimized release of Teacup. These builds give the highest performance when rendering and disable runtime checks.

For debug builds, provide `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` when running CMake.

License
====================

Teacup as a whole is licensed under the MIT license.
